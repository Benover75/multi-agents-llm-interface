🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Ollama installed on your system
Python 3.8+ (for backend server)
Modern web browser

1. Install Ollama Models
bash# Pull the required models
ollama pull tinyllama:latest
ollama pull tinydolphin:latest


# Option 2: Python HTTP server

python -m http.server 8080

# Then visit <http://localhost:8080>


🔧 Configuration
Model Assignments
Edit backend/config.py to customize which models power each agent:
pythonAGENT_MODELS = {
    "ResearchBot": "tinyllama:latest",
    "CreativeBot": "tinydolphin:latest",
    "ResumeBot": "tinyllama:latest",
    "SummaryBot": "tinydolphin:latest"
}
Ollama Settings
pythonOLLAMA_BASE_URL = "<http://localhost:11434>"
MAX_TOKENS = 2048
TEMPERATURE = 0.7

🔧 Development
Backend Development
bash# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt


🚀 Deployment
Local Network Access
bash# Make accessible on local network
python backend/app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
Docker Deployment
bash# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t multi-agent-llm .
docker run -p 5000:5000 -p 8080:8080 multi-agent-llm
🛠️ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Ollama Connection Error:
bash# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Start Ollama service

ollama serve
Models Not Found:
bash# Re-pull models
ollama pull tinyllama:latest
ollama pull tinydolphin:latest
CORS Issues:

Ensure backend CORS headers are properly configured
Use http:// instead of file:// protocol

Performance Tips

GPU Acceleration: Ensure Ollama uses GPU if available
Memory: Allocate sufficient RAM for model loading
Concurrent Requests: Limit simultaneous agent requests
